Notes = Prior to the concatenated parmlib support available with OS/390® Release 2, IPCS used an IPCSPARM data set to identify the members required for its processing. If an IPCSPARM data ser was not allocated at the time IPCS was invoked, IPCS dynamically allocated SYS1.PARMLIB for the duration of the IPCS session and unallocated it when complete.
